        <p>
          Based in Chicago, Illinois, Little Lemon is a family owned Mediterranean restaurant, 
          focused on traditional recipes served with a modern twist.
        </p>

          of 12-15 items that they rotate seasonally. The restaurant has a rustic and relaxed 
          atmosphere with moderate prices, making it a popular place for a meal any time of the day.

        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <img src="{% static 'img/Mario and Adrian b.jpg' %}" alt="Mario and Adrian">
        <p>
          Little Lemon is owned by two Italian brothers, Mario and Adrian, who moved to the 
          United States to pursue their shared dream of owning a restaurant.
        </p>
        <p>
          To craft the menu, Mario relies on family recipes and his experience as a chef in Italy, 
          and Adrian does all the marketing for the restaurant and led the effort to expand the menu 
          beyond classic Italian to incorporate additional cuisines from the Mediterranean region.
